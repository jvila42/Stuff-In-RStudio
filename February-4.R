#  February 4

#  We will begin by talking about different
#  types of files, and their uses

#  Reading files using a path statement
#  instead of file.choose().
#  R wants only forward slashes, so if
#  your path has backward ones, change them.

#  Try reading in the groceries data again:
#  G <- read.csv("  path statement ")


#  
#  Next, we created an R markdown file 
#  We started by clicking File, then
#  New File, then R Markdown.  Then select
#  From Template (on the left), and choose
#  the DataComputing Simple Template.  

#  Edit the template to look like the 
#  file  practice.Rmd (also attached)
